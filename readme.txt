Cookie Calculator is a Java program for Orteil's Cookie Clicker browser game. (http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)

Cookie Calculator does not calculate the most optimal building order, nor does it inform you of what to buy next.

Instead, this program provides a few convenient functions that will make certain decisions in the game easier, without necessarily telling you the optimal way to play.

Available Quantity: Calculates the amount of buildings that can be purchased, given the current number of cookies banked.

Cost: Calculates the current cost of the building.

Refund Amount: Calculates the refund value of x buildings, factoring in the total number of buildings purchased.

Cookies Needed: Given a target number of buildings to reach, this displays the amount of cookies that must be obtained in order to reach your "target" value. Factors in the current number of cookies banked.

In order to run this program:

1. run java -jar "Cookie Calculator.jar" from the command line.
3. Right click the file and open it with Java 7 Runtime.
